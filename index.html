        <p><em>Learning how to live with a rare lung disease and not have a panic attack every hour.</em></p>
        <p>I was diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans just about two years ago after a trip to the ICU. I landed again in the ICU just this past May with an acute infection in my lungs which propelled me into the transplant treatment plan and I am currently listed on the national wait list for a double lung transplant! Prior to the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans, I was diagnosed and am still challenged by oral lichen planus and lichen planus which I have been working with teams of doctors over the past six years to get under control. I believe these two diseases are linked somehow but don't have the knowledge or expertise to connect the dots -- however I do believe that someday there will be a better understanding of how and why these two autoimmune diseases impacted me and my life and the lives of many others and I hope to be helpful in that discovery. Other than my medical challenges, I enjoy reading and writing and always continuing to learn new things as well as relaxing with my family.</p></td>
